This repository contains code that is contained in several folders:

1) In the folder Exercise_1 there is a program, the initialization of which occurs after the user enters a five-digit number, after which it is checked to see if the number is a palindrome.

2) In the folder Exercise_2 there is a program, the initialization of which occurs after the user enters the coordinates of two points, after which it finds the distance between them in 3D space.

3) In the folder Exercise_3 there is a program, the initialization of which occurs after entering a number, after which the user is given his cubic table.
